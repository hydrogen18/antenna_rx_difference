This is a project I created to generate comparisons of two WSJT-X files generated by two separate receivers using
two separate antennas over the same time frame.

It is in a usable state, but fairly rough at the moment. I may improve upon it further in the near future.

## Example usage

```
python -m antenna_rx_difference antenna_0_wsjtx.txt antenna_1_wsjtx.txt
```
